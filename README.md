========

This repository is a sample project built with Symfony 3 and Vue.js. The project is heavily inspired by [DDD Cargo Sample in PHP](https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample) and serves as another example (good or not) of implementing DDD on a ‘real’ domain model.

*I'm still working on the project so some of the features are not implemented yet.*
